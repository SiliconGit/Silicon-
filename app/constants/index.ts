export const ABOUT_TEXT: string = `
I'm a 13-year-old Indian Developer who started with his journey in 5th grade with my uncle's guidance. I've delved into HTML for layout, CSS for design, Sass for better CSS code, JavaScript for interaction, and moved on to TypeScript for better structure and safety. Discovering React transformed how I do frontend, its component-based setup makes my code modular and easy to maintain. I later moved on Next.js to improve my work with SSR and SEO benefits. Programming isn't just a hobby; it's my creative outlet and a way to solve real problems.
